Introduction:
    Q: What is this for?
    A: just some basic data manipulation, and graph rendering
    
    Q: Why did I make this?
    A: Bored :/

    This is a command line? Library? I don't know yet at this stage of the project.
    But the biggest part of this project is the 'render' function.

    'render' generates a graph based on the set of data, and prints it to the terminal.
    There hasn't been much testing done for varying displays and terminals, mostly
    just the basic most function so far. I'd like to also do more than just bar graphs,
    but so far I'm trying to implement other functions to handle the data and provide
    meaningful data.

///
Commands:
    exit        - It just ends the program lols
    print x     - Prints the first x rows of the data
    average x   - TODO* finds the average value in column x
    render x    - Renders the first 10 values in column x
    render x y  - Renders the first y values in column x
    sort x      - TODO* Sorts the data based on values in column x
    meta        - Prints meta data for provided dataset
    man         - Prints these Commands
///

I'll be honest, I can't say what direction I want to take this project since I kind of
just made this on a whim without considering any software engineering practices. I should
try to implement those in the future, tho a lot of it comes in the form of group work, so
really I'll just be creating diagrams for myself? But it could help with any future 
refactors that may arise when I feel like adding a new feature (or help me layout the 
features I want to add).
